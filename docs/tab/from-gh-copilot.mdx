title: Migrate from GitHub Copilot

### Tab Improvements

The biggest difference is the way Devinai and GitHub Copilot complete code.

GitHub Copilot can insert text at your devinai position. It cannot edit the code around your devinai or remove text.

Devinai can insert text at your devinai, and much more:

-   Multi-character edits
    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/cpp/multi-edit.png" />
    </Frame>
-   Instruction-based edits
    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/cpp/instruct.png" />
    </Frame>

Further, Devinai has a history of your recent changes in the context window, so it knows what you are trying to do next.

### Migrate from GitHub Copilot

Since Devinai comes by default with GitHub Copilot, you might have GitHub Copilot and Devinai installed at the same time. We recommend turning off GitHub Copilot when you want to use Devinai.

By default, Devinai takes precedence over GitHub Copilot. If you want to use GitHub Copilot, you can [disable Devinai](/tab/overview#copilot-settings) in the settings.
