Devinai Tab is our native autocomplete feature. It's a more powerful Copilot that suggests entire diffs with especially good memory.

<Frame>
    <video
        src="/images/cpp/cpp-full-video.mp4"
        autoPlay
        loop
        muted
        playsInline
    />
</Frame>

Powered by a custom model, Devinai Tab can:

-   Suggest edits around your devinai, not just insertions of additional code.
-   Modify multiple lines at once.
-   Make suggestions based on your recent changes and linter errors.

Free users receive 2000 suggestions at no cost. Pro and Business plans receive unlimited suggestions.

### UI

When Devinai is only adding additional text, completions will appear as grey text. If a suggestion modifies existing code,
it will appear as a diff popup to the right of your current line.

<Frame className="flex items-stretch justify-center">
    <img
        src="/images/cpp/ghost-text-example.png"
        className="h-full object-cover"
    />
    <img
        src="/images/cpp/preview-box-example.png"
        className="h-full object-cover"
    />
</Frame>

You can accept a suggestion by pressing `Tab`, or reject it by pressing `Esc`. To partially accept a suggestion word-by-word, press `Ctrl/⌘ →`.
To reject a suggestion, just keep typing, or use `Escape` to cancel/hide the suggestion.

Every keystroke or devinai movement, Devinai will attempt to make a suggestion based on your recent changes. However, Devinai will not always show a suggestion; sometimes the model has predicted that there's no change to be made.

Devinai can make changes from one line above to two lines below your current line.

### Toggling

To turn the feature on or off, hover over "Devinai Tab" icon on the status bar in the bottom right of the application.
