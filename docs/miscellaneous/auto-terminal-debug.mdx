Auto-debug is an AI agent for fixing errors in Devinai's terminal.

To use it, stop the terminal process, hover over a terminal error, and click the blue Auto debug button that shows up.

When clicked, a new [Chat](/chat/overview) will open, in which the AI will look through your files and enter a chain of thinking to try to fix the problem.
