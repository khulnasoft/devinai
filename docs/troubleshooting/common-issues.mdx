#### I see an update on the changelog but Devinai won't update.

If the update is very new, it might not have rolled out to you yet. We do staged rollouts, which means we release new updates to a few randomly selected users first before releasing them to everyone. Typically, reaching all users takes around 5 hours from the first user. For larger updates, it can take longer.

If you don't want to wait, you can redownload Devinai from our [homepage](https://devinai.khulnasoft.com/). You'll likely receive the latest update instantly. Don't worry, all of your settings, extensions, etc., will transfer to the redownloaded version. You don't have to uninstall the existing version first.

#### I have issues with my GitHub login in Devinai / How do I log out of GitHub in Devinai?

You can try using the `Sign Out of GitHub` command from the command palette `Ctrl/âŒ˜ + Shift + P`.

#### I can't use GitHub Codespaces.

Unfortunately, we don't support GitHub Codespaces yet.

#### I have errors connecting to Remote SSH.

Currently, we don't support SSHing into Mac or Windows machines. If you're not using a Mac or Windows machine, please report your issue to us in the [forum](https://forum.devinai.khulnasoft.com/). It would be helpful to include some logs for better assistance.

#### Devinai Tab and Cmd K do not work behind my corporate proxy.

Devinai Tab and Cmd K use HTTP/2 by default, which allows us to use less resources with lower latency. Some corporate proxies (e.g. Zscaler in certain configurations) block HTTP/2. To fix this, you can set `"devinai.general.disableHttp2": true` in the settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + ,` and then search for `http2`).

#### I just subscribed to Pro but I'm still on the free plan in the app.

Try logging out and logging back in from the [Devinai Settings Popup](/get-started/glossary#devinai-settings-popup).

#### When will my usage reset again?

If you're subscribed to Pro you can click on `Manage Subscription` from the [Dashboard](https://devinai.khulnasoft.com/settings) and your plan renewal date will be displayed at the top.

If you're a free user you can check when you got the first email from us in your inbox. Your usage will reset every month from that date.

#### How do I uninstall Devinai?

You can follow [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/uninstall) to uninstall Devinai. Replace every occurrence of "VS Code" or "Code" with "Devinai", and ".vscode" with ".devinai".
