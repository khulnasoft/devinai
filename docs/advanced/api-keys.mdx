### OpenAI API Keys

Devinai lets you input your own OpenAI API key to send as many AI messages as you want at your own cost.

You can get your own API key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). To use your own API key, go to `Devinai Settings` > `Models` > `OpenAI API Key` and enter your API key. Then, click on the "Verify" button. Once your key is validated, your OpenAI API key will be enabled.

Similar to OpenAI, you can also set your own Anthropic API key so that you will be using claude-based models at your own cost.

### Will my API key be stored or leave my device?

Your API key will not be stored, but it will be sent up to our server with every request. All requests are routed through our backend, because that's where we do the final prompt building.
