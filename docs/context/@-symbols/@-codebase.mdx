### `@Codebase`

Through `@Codebase`, Devinai Chat goes through these steps until it finds the most important pieces of code to use.

-   Gathering: scanning through your codebase for important files / code chunks
-   Reranking: reordering the context items based on relevancy to the query
-   Reasoning: thinking through a plan of using the context
-   Generating: coming up with a response

Another way of submitting an advanced codebase query is to click on the dropdown next to the `Ctrl/âŒ˜ + Enter` button and select `reranker` for the search behavior.
This is only available when `@Codebase` isn't used, otherwise `@Codebase` takes precedence.
