title: Basic Usage
---

In Devinai's AI input boxes, such as in Cmd K, Chat, or Terminal Cmd K, you can use @ symbols by typing `@`. A popup menu will appear with a list of suggestions,
and it will automatically filter to only show the most relevant suggestions based on your input.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

You can navigate through the list of suggestions using the up/down arrow keys. You can hit `Enter` to select a suggestion. If the suggestion is a category, such as `Files`,
the suggestions will be filtered to only show the most relevant items within that category.

### Cmd K Keyboard Shortcut

You can use the up/down arrow key to navigate through the list of selected Cmd K @ symbols, `Enter` to expand/collapse the selected context item. For file references, you can use
`Ctrl/âŒ˜ M` to toggle the file reading strategies. Read more about file reading strategies [here](/context/@-symbols/@-files#cmd-k-chunking-strategy).
