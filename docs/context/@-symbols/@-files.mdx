### `@Files`

In AI input boxes such as in Devinai Chat and Cmd K, you can reference entire files by using `@Files`.
Also, if you continue to type after `@`, you will see your file search results after the [`@Code`](/context/@-symbols/@-code) strategy.

In order to make sure the file you're referencing is the correct file, Devinai will show a preview of the file's path. This is especially useful when you have multiple files with the same name in different folders.

### Chat Long File References

In Devinai's Chat, if the contents of a file is too long, Devinai will chunk the file into smaller chunks and rerank them based on relevance to the query.

### Cmd K Chunking Strategy

For Cmd K, Devinai uses the file references differently based on the content length as well.

-   auto
    -   Automatically pick one of the three reading strategies based on the file size
-   full file
    -   The entire file is used as context.
-   outline
    -   Devinai parses the outline of the file and uses the information as context.
-   chunks
    -   Devinai chunks the file into smaller chunks and picks the most relevant one.

### Drag and Drop

You can drag and drop files from the primary sidebar into Chat or Cmd K to add them as context as well.
