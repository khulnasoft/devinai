**[Devinai](https://khulnasoft.com) is an editor made for programming with AI.** It's early days, but right now Devinai can help you with a few things...

-   **Write**: Generate 10-100 lines of code with an AI that's smarter than Copilot
-   **Diff**: Ask the AI to edit a block of code, see only proposed changes
-   **Chat**: ChatGPT-style interface that understands your current file
-   **And more**: ask to fix lint errors, generate tests/comments on hover, etc.

## Getting Started

Head over to [our website](https://khulnasoft.com/) to download and try out the editor.

Feel free to file tickets for bugs or feature requests. Upvote üëç the ones you'd like us to prioritize.

## Roadmap

Long term, our plan is to build Devinai into the world's most productive development environment. Using LLMs, we want to do things like:

-   "Heal" your repository when you're halfway through a refactor
-   Allow you to code by editing a "pseudocode" version of your codebase
-   Auto-fix errors as soon as they show up in your terminal
-   Embed AI-written documentation into the UI

## Development

(This repo currently houses our `0.1.x` branch)

To get started:

```
git clone git@github.com:khulnasoft/devinai.git
cd devinai
npm i
```

Then, download some non-versioned dependencies (ripgrep binaries and language server js):

```
./setup.sh # Mac/Linux
./setup.ps1 # Windows
```

Finally, to run the client:

```
npm start
```
